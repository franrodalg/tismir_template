\section{Backmatter content}\label{sec:backmatter}

Unlike the original Word template, in here we assume all backmatter
content will be included in unnumbered sections.
We show an acknowledgements section at the end of this document
as an example, as well as how references look like in the style
required by the journal.
In this section, we group together all remarks related with such
content.

\subsection{Reproducibility (if applicable)}

If the content of your submission relates to data or software 
that has been deposited in a code or preservation repository,
please provide summary information here, along with a DOI that
links to the deposited code/data.

\subsection{Acknowledgements}

Any acknowledgements must be headed and in a separate paragraph, 
placed after the main text but before the reference list.

\subsection{Competing interests}

If any of the authors have any competing interests then these
must be declared. A short paragraph should be placed before
the references. 
Guidelines for competing interests can be found \href{http://transactions.ismir.net/information/competingInterestGuidelines}{here}.%

\subsection{Ethics and consent}

If your research human or animal subjects, the appropriate ethics
committee must have approved the research and a statement added here,
including the name of the committee and reference number of approval.
Human subjects must have provided informed prior consent 
to participate in the study.

\subsection{References}

All citations must be listed at the end of the text file,
in alphabetical order of authors' surnames.
References should not be listed if they are not cited in 
the main text.
This journal uses the APA system. 
Please visit 
\href{http://transactions.ismir.net/about/submissions/#References}{the journal}
for examples of referencing format.

In this template, you can use \verb=\citep{}= to include references 
surrounded by parentheses, such as~\citep{fakeref}, and \verb=\citet{}=
for references embedded in the text, such as~\citet{fakeref}.
