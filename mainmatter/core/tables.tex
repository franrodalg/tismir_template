\section{Tables}\label{sec:tables}

Tables must be created using a word processor's table function, 
not tabbed text. 
Tables should be included in the manuscript.
The final layout will place the tables as close to their first
citation as possible.

All tables must be cited within the main text, numbered with Arabic 
numerals in consecutive order (e.g. Table 1, Table 2, etc.).

Each table must have an accompanying descriptive title.
This should clearly and concisely summarise the content and/or 
use of the table. 
A short additional table legend is optional to offer a further
description of the table.

\subsection{Tables should not include}

\begin{itemize}
\item Rotated text
\item Colour to denote meaning (it will not display the same on all devices)
\item Images
\item Vertical or diagonal lines
\item Multiple parts (e.g. ``Table 1a'' and ``Table 1b'').
These should either be merged into one table,
or separated into ``Table 1'' and ``Table 1''.
\end{itemize}

\begin{table}[htpb]

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
