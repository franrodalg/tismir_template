\section{Footnotes}\label{sec:footnotes}

Use endnotes rather than footnotes 
(we refer to these as ``Notes'' in the online publication). 
These will appear at the end of the main text, before ``References''.
All notes should be used only where crucial clarifying information
needs to be conveyed.
Avoid using notes for purposes of referencing, with in-text citations used 
instead. 
If in-text citations cannot be used, a source can be cited as part of a note.
Please insert the endnote marker after the end punctuation.

To this end, n this version of the \LaTeX\ template, the authors can
use the \verb=\footnote{}= command, as shown in Sec.~\ref{sec:introduction}, 
as well as \verb=\endnote{}=.\endnote{For instance, here}
