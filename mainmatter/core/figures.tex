\section{Figures}\label{sec:figures}

Figures must all be cited in the main text, in sequential order. 
All figures should be placed within the text file upon submission and during
the review process. Figures/images have a resolution of at least 150dpi 
(300dpi or above preferred). The files are in one of the following formats:
JPG, TIFF, GIF, PNG, EPS (to maximise quality,
the original source file is preferred).

After editorial acceptance, you will be asked to provide the figure 
images in high resolution files, rather than in the submission file, 
so that this quality is transferred into the publication.
The typesetting process will place the figures in an appropriate 
location in the PDF.

Each figure must have an accompanying descriptive main title.
This should clearly and concisely summarise the content and/or
use of the figure image.
A short additional figure legend is optional to offer a further description.
